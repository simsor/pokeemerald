# Pokémon Emerald - French translation

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald based on [`pret/pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald). This fork aims at translating the whole game in French, in order to allow for better French language ROM hacks.

The goal of this fork is **not** to be a byte-for-byte recreation of AGB-BPEF.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
